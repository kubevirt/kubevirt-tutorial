# Lab 0: Overview

This lab is targeted towards people who donâ€™t have any KubeVirt experience.

However, knowledge of Kubernetes and familiarity witht the *kubectl* command line tool is assumed.

The goal of the workshop is to show you how to deploy KubeVirt and get familiar with it. Each participant will work on an all-in-one Kubernetes cluster, on top of which we will:

* Deploy and explore KubeVirt
* Deploy a virtual machine (VM) using KubeVirt
* Create a VM that has persistent storage
* Explore the KubeVirt web UI
* Create a multi-homed VM using Multus
* Explore metrics through Grafana

## Requirements

The clusters for the lab are deployed externally, and the only requisite to follow the workshop is a laptop with a modern web browser to access the web UI and an SSH client to connect to the cluster and execute all the commands.
