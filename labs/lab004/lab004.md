# Lab 4: Deploy your first Virtual Machine

**DISCLAIMER:** This header is just for our own purpose, then **you don't need execute it!**:

```bash @mdsh
mdsh-lang-bash() { shell; }
```

We will deploy a VM that uses a [ContainerDisk](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/creating-virtual-machines/disks-and-volumes.html#containerdisk). Therefore, the VM will not use any of the available Persistent Volumes (PVs), as ContainerDisk based storage is ephemeral.

```shell
## LAB004

kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default
kubectl apply -f $HOME/student-materials/vm_containerdisk.yml
```

- Output:
```
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/vm1 created
```

Check the VM that we just created:

```shell
kubectl get vm vm1
```

- Output:
```
NAME   AGE   RUNNING   VOLUME
vm1    24s   false
```

Notice it's not running. This is because in its YAML definition we can find the following:

```
...
spec:
  running: false
...
```

## Start the Virtual Machine

The *VirtualMachine* object is the definition of our VM, but a running VM is represented by a *VirtualMachineInstance*. Our VM is not instantiated yet, let's do so using *virtctl* as follows:

```shell
virtctl start vm1
```

- Output:
```
VM vm1 was scheduled to start
```

A *virt-launcher* Pod should be starting now, which will spawn the actual virtual machine instance (or VMI):

- With this command you will be sure that the vm instance has been created and the VM has started
```shell
while ! kubectl get vmi vm1 -n default --no-headers && echo 'Looping...'; do sleep 5; done
kubectl wait vmi vm1 --timeout=600s --for condition=Ready
```

- The usual K8s command is:
```
kubectl get pods -w
```

- Output:
```
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   0/2     Running   0          12s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   0/2     Running   0          12s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   1/2     Running   0          17s
virt-launcher-vm1-2qflc   2/2     Running   0          23s
```

We can also use *kubectl* to check the virtual machine and its instance:

```shell
kubectl get vm vm1
```

- Output:
```
NAME   AGE   RUNNING   VOLUME
vm1    19m   true
```

```shell
kubectl get vmi vm1
```

- Output:
```
NAME   AGE     PHASE     IP            NODENAME
vm1    3m49s   Running   10.244.0.22   kubevirtlab-2
```

Using *virtctl* we can connect to the VMI's console as follows:

```
virtctl console vm1
```

- Output:
```
Successfully connected to vm1 console. The escape sequence is ^]

vm1 login:
```

In order to verify that the VM is up and running just ensure that you could reach over ssh using this command:
```
VM_IP="$(kubectl get vmi vm1 -o jsonpath='{.status.interfaces[0].ipAddress}')"
```

**NOTE**: To exit the console press *Ctrl+]*

There is also a graphical console to connect to the VMs, using *virtctl vnc* instead of *virtctl console*. This requires you to have a VNC client like *remote-viewer* installed on your system. In this lab we are executing *virtctl* remotely on the lab instance, and therefore we can't use this option. Instead, we will access a VM's graphical console in a later lab through the web UI.

You could shutdown the vm using this command:
```shell
virtctl stop vm1
```

And you could erase the VM definition using this other one:
```shell
kubectl delete vm vm1 -n default
```


### Exercise

Can you operate on the VM and VMI objects using standard *kubectl* commands without relying on *virtctl*?

In particular, can you start or stop a VM without *virtctl*?

## Recap

* We defined a *VirtualMachine* object on the cluster. This didn't actually instantiate the *vm1* VM.
* We started the *vm1* using *virtctl*, which instantiated it creating the *VirtualMachineInstance* object
  * *kubectl patch* could have also been used to start *vm1*
* Finally, we connected to the *vm1's* serial console using *virtctl*

This concludes this section of the lab, before heading off to the next lab, spend some time describing and exploring the objects this lab created on the cluster.
