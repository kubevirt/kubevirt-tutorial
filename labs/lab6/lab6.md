## Use KubeVirt

### Create a Virtual Machine

Download the VM manifest and explore it. Note it uses a [registry disk](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/#/workloads/virtual-machines/disks-and-volumes?id=registrydisk) and as such doesn't persist data. Such registry disks currently exist for alpine, cirros and fedora.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubevirt/demo/master/manifests/vm.yaml
less vm.yaml
```

Apply the manifest to OpenShift.

```
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubevirt/demo/master/manifests/vm.yaml
  virtualmachine.kubevirt.io "testvm" created
  virtualmachineinstancepreset.kubevirt.io "small" created
```

### Manage Virtual Machines (optional):

To get a list of existing Virtual Machines. Note the `running` status.

```
oc get vms
oc get vms -o yaml testvm
```

To start a Virtual Machine you can use:

```
./virtctl start testvm
```

Now that the Virtual Machine has been started, check the status. Note the `running` status.

```
oc get vms
oc get vms -o yaml testvm
```

### Accessing VMs (serial console & spice)

Connect to the serial console of the Cirros VM. Hit return / enter a few times and login with the displayed username and password. 

```
./virtctl console testvm
```

### Communication Between Application and Virtual Machine

While in the console of the `testvm` let's run `curl` to confirm our virtual machine
can access the `Service` of the application deployment.

```
curl ara.myproject.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

The expected output from the curl command should be:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>Redirecting...</title>
<h1>Redirecting...</h1>
<p>You should be redirected automatically to target URL: <a href="/about/">/about/</a>.  If not click the link.
```

Disconnect from the virtual machine console by typing: `ctrl+]`.

Connect to the graphical display.

Note: Requires `remote-viewer` from the `virt-viewer` package. This is out of scope for this lab. 

```
./virtctl vnc testvm
```

Connect using service 

We can "expose" any port of the vm so that we can access it from the outside.
For instance, run the following to expose the ssh port of your vm

```
./virtctl expose vm testvm --port=22 --node-port=30000 --target-port=22 --name=testvm-ssh --type=NodePort
```

You can then access to your vm from the outside

```
ssh -p 30000 cirros@student<number>.cnvlab.gce.sysdeseng.com
```

### Controlling the State of the VM

To shut it down:

```
./virtctl stop testvm
```

To delete a Virtual Machine:

```
oc delete vms testvm
```
